# 🚀 LeetCode 150 - Top Interview Questions

Welcome to my LeetCode 150 repository! This project contains my Java-based solutions for the [Top 150 Interview Questions on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/), organized for quick reference and learning.

My goal is to stay sharp with algorithms and data structures by consistently solving high-quality problems and maintaining clean, readable code.

> 💡 You might find **interesting or unconventional approaches** here that are not readily available on the internet — I often explore alternative ways to solve classic problems.
